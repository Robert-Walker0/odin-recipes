	    <h2>Description</h2>
	    <p>This king cake is the best combination of several iterations of it. It's not too sweet, bready but it has a rich tender crumb and traditionally lemon and nutmeg flavors of a genuine NOLA king cake</p>
	    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	    <h3>Sweet Dough:</h3>
	    <ul>
		    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
		    <li>1/2 cup white sugar </li>
		    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package rapid rise yeast </li>
		    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
		    <li>3 eggs at room temperature</li>
		    <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
		    <li>3/4 cup Bulgarin-style buttermilk</li>
	    </ul> 
	    <h3>Cream Cheese Filling:</h3>
	    <ul>
		    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese at room tempature</li>
		    <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
		    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (Optional)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Egg Wash</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>1/4 cup water</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Icing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons corn syrup</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons milk</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl.</li>
			<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk in buttermilk and heat until an instant-read thermometer reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). Slowly pour buttermilk mixture into beaten eggs, whisking constantly; let cool to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Beat egg mixture into flour mixture on medium-low speed until a firm, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. If dough doesn't separate from the sides of the mixing bowl during kneading, beat in up to 1/4 cup more flour.</li>
			<li>Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead for 1 minute. Shape dough into a ball and place into a buttered bowl, turning dough to lightly coat all over with butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the outside edge of an 8-inch cake pan.</li>
			<li>Make the filling: Stir cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, flour, lemon juice, vanilla, and nutmeg in a bowl until smooth.</li>
			<li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Roll dough into a 10x28-inch rectangle. Spread filling over the rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border along each edge. Starting at one long edge of the rectangle, lift the parchment paper sheet and roll dough into a log. Pinch the seams closed to seal in the filling, keeping the roll on the parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Wrap the filled dough around the outer edges of the prepared cake pan and pinch the dough ends to form a ring. Use parchment paper to lift the cake and cake pan and slide a baking sheet beneath the parchment. Gently free the cake pan, leaving the ring-shaped cake.</li>
			<li>Make the egg wash: Whisk egg with water in a small bowl. Brush over cake.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, make the icing: Stir confectioners' sugar, corn syrup, and milk together in a bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or as much as needed to thin icing to a thick but slightly runny texture.</li>
			<li>Drizzle icing over cooled king cake.</li>
		</ol>
