        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Stuffing bread pudding is the perfect side to your Thanksgiving dinner. Use slightly stale bread, lightly toasted, for best results.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread: Start with six cups of soft cubed bread.</li>
            <li>Butter: Cook the vegetables in melted butter.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: You’ll need a yellow onion and celery.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: Season the stuffed bread pudding with fresh garlic, dried thyme, dried sage, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>White wine vinegar: White wine vinegar adds welcome brightness and helps deglaze the pan.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs keep the stuffing from drying out and help bind the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Half-and-half: Half-and-half lends moisture and rich flavor.</li>
            <li>Cheese: You’ll need a combination of shredded gouda and grated Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the bread cubes.</li>
            <li>Cook the vegetables in butter until the onions are translucent, then add the seasonings.</li>
            <li>Add white wine vinegar and cook for 1 minute, stirring and scraping the pan.</li>
            <li>Combine the toasted bread cubes and onion mixture in one bowl, then combine the eggs with the half-and-half and cheeses in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the bowls, then spread the mixture in a prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for two hours or overnight, then let the mixture come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Bake until the center is set and the top is golden brown.</li>
